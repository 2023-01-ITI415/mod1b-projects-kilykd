 Prototype 1

Seeing as how our previous prototypes were recreations of actual games, I decided to continue this trend by basing my prototype off of a game that already existed so I had some reference when creating the game. The game I attempted to recreate is a minigame within a game called Pummel Party. Pummel Party is Mario Party style game that is available on Steam. The minigame that I based my prototype on is called Spooky Spikes, and it involves a player standing on a platform above a pit of lava. The players are then faced with waves spikes that must be either jumped over or crouched under. If a player gets hit by one of the spikes, their character is moved slightly back towards the edge of the platform, and once you get hit about 4 or 5  times the player falls in the lava. As time progresses, the speed and frequency of the incoming spikes is increased. I thought that this idea would be simple enough to recreate because it seemed like we had covered most of the core mechanics in the previous games. There would be some hit detection for when the player made contact with the spikes like, the player would need to be able to jump and crouch, and there would be an game object that instantiated prefabs similar to that of the apple tree from Apple Picker. While jump mechanic was easy enough, implementing a crouch turned out to be beyond my skills, so I ended up just going with a jump. My goal was to make a game that had simple mechanics and was easy to understand, but was also difficult at the same time. While I believe that this prototype could have turned out better, I am happy that all of the core mechanics are there and I think that it is a fun challenge. s
